When working with NSCC I was told to collect the data from a student survey.

Normally how this was done, someone would just tick a line on a piece of paper for which response the student chose for that particular question. I thought that this process took a long time and was not very efficient so I built a program using java to collect and put the data into a digital copy faster.
